# Jeopardy
A generic Jeopardy board written in Python + GTK

How this works:
+ *questions.json* holds the questions, grouped by category,
+ *answers.json* holds the answers, also grouped by category.

Edit the category names in both of them, and then in **main.py** change the *nameList* to the names of the categories you just put in.

put everythin in one directory and run it with *$python main.py*

That's pretty much it. Past that it's pretty basic, but it looks nice on my machine at least. Thinking of adding teams and scoring built in but that's in the future when I have more time
